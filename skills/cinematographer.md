# Cinematographer — H3 Max shot craft

`bridge` and `storyboard` handle continuity ACROSS shots. This skill is what happens INSIDE one shot:
how to write an H3 Max prompt so the clip has a beginning, a middle and an end instead of five seconds of
a person standing still, and how the length you pick changes what you are allowed to write.

Use it for every H3 shot. Use it with `bridge`/`storyboard` when there is more than one.

## The hard numbers (H3 Max)

- `durationSeconds`: any integer 5–15. Anything outside clamps silently, so ask for what you want.
- `resolution`: "480p" or "768p". Nothing else exists.
- `aspectRatio`: 21:9, 16:9, 4:3, 1:1, 3:4, 9:16.
- Variants: `h3-max-t2v` (prompt only), `h3-max-i2v` (a starting frame), `h3-max-r2v` (reference images
  or a reference video). Set `videoReferenceMode` yourself; never ask the user which mode was meant.

## Duration decides the structure — this is the whole skill

A clip is not "the same shot, longer". Each length supports a different number of events, and writing a
15-second prompt for a 5-second clip is why a clip looks rushed and truncated. Pick the length from the
number of things that need to happen, then write to that structure.

**5s — ONE event.** A single continuous action with no change of state. She turns her head. The match
strikes. The car passes. One camera move, one subject action, and they are the same beat. Do not write a
before-and-after. Do not write two verbs. 5 seconds is a held moment, and it is the most reliable length
H3 produces — when a shot matters, prefer 5s and cut, rather than 10s and hope.

**10s — TWO beats with a hinge.** Setup, then a turn. The hinge is the word that gives the model
permission to change something: *then*, *as*, *until*, *before*. "He scans the empty platform, **then**
his eyes catch something off-frame left and he goes still." One hinge only. Two hinges is a 15s clip
being asked to fit in 10 and it will drop one of them.

**15s — THREE beats, and one of them must be the camera.** A subject cannot hold attention for 15 seconds
by itself; something in the frame has to keep changing. Structure it as: establish → develop → resolve,
with the camera carrying at least one of the three (a push that lands on a detail, a pan that reveals a
second subject, a rack focus). Write them as three sentences, in order, one action each. If you cannot
name three distinct beats, this is a 10s shot and you should say so.

Above 15s there is no clip — there is a sequence. Split it into shots and follow `bridge`.

## Prompt shape

Order matters; H3 weights the front of the prompt hardest. Always this order:

```
[SHOT SIZE + LENS] [SUBJECT, locked description] [ACTION, in beats matched to the duration]
[CAMERA MOVE] [LIGHT] [ENVIRONMENT] [GRADE / STOCK]
```

- Name the shot size explicitly — *extreme close-up, close-up, medium, medium-wide, wide, extreme wide*.
  Left unsaid, H3 defaults to a flat medium and everything you generate cuts together badly.
- Name the lens in millimetres. 24mm for wides and drama-by-distortion, 35mm for naturalism, 50mm for
  neutral, 85mm for portraits and compression, 135mm for isolating a subject in chaos.
- Describe light by DIRECTION and QUALITY, never as a mood word. "Hard low sun from frame left, long
  shadows" survives; "moody lighting" does not.
- Present tense, active verbs, no adjective stacks. "Rain hammers the windscreen" beats "a beautiful,
  cinematic, dramatic rainy scene".
- Never write what is NOT in frame. Negatives put the thing in the shot.

## The three registers

The register changes the camera and the cutting length, not just the adjectives.

### Realistic
The camera is an observer that arrived slightly late and does not know what will happen.
- Handheld with real weight, or a locked-off tripod. Small reframes, never perfectly centred.
- 35mm, eye height, natural available light — window light, overcast, practical lamps.
- Behaviour over action: someone waits, checks a phone, adjusts a sleeve. Let the beat be unremarkable.
- Duration: 5–10s. Realism reads as duration, so a held 10s of nothing much is the register working.
- Grade: low contrast, slightly desaturated, visible grain, no colour push.

### Dramatic
The camera knows what is about to happen and is withholding it.
- Slow deliberate moves only: a 6-second push, a slow dolly, a rack focus that lands late. No handheld
  jitter — instability reads as documentary, which is the opposite register.
- 85mm or longer, shallow focus, subject off-centre with weight in the empty side of frame.
- Hard directional key with deep unfilled shadow; let half the face go.
- The beat is a decision or a realisation, not an event. Faces, hands, stillness, a held breath.
- Duration: 10s, occasionally 15s. Drama needs the time the audience spends waiting.
- Grade: high contrast, crushed blacks, restrained palette — two colours, not five.

### Action
The camera is inside the event and struggling to keep up.
- Whip pans, fast dollies, handheld tracking, a locked frame the subject explodes through. Motion blur
  is a feature; say so.
- 24mm close to the subject for speed and distortion, or 135mm compressed for impact.
- ONE action per clip even here — especially here. "He vaults the rail" is a shot; "he vaults the rail,
  lands, rolls, and draws" is four shots and H3 will smear them into none.
- Duration: 5s. Almost always 5s. Action reads through cutting, not through clip length — three 5s clips
  beat one 15s clip every time, and each one can be its own camera position.
- Grade: high contrast, cool highlights, heavy blacks. Add "shot at 1/48 shutter" for natural blur or
  "high shutter speed, crisp motion" for the staccato look.

## Stacking beats into a narrative

A cohesive piece is built from lengths, not just content. Vary them on purpose:

- **5+5** — statement and reaction. The most reliable 10 seconds you can make.
- **10+5** — a beat that develops, then a hard cut to its consequence. The workhorse.
- **5+10+5** — hit, hold, release. This is a scene.
- **15** alone — only when the shot IS the piece: a oner, an establishing shot, a single held performance.

Never run three 15s clips back to back. Equal-length shots read as a slideshow; the change in length is
what the audience feels as rhythm.

Hold constant across every clip in one piece: model, `aspectRatio`, `resolution`, register, lens family,
light direction and grade. Change only shot size, camera move and duration. That is the difference
between a sequence and a folder of clips.

## Before you generate

State in one line: the register, the shot list with each clip's length and shot size, and the total
runtime. Price the whole thing once with `estimate_cost`, take one yes, then shoot all of it without
stopping to re-ask.

## After

Assemble with `set_timeline` (the whole ordered list, every time), then `save_cut` with the register,
the locked look, and every shot's exact prompt, length and URL — so the next piece in the same world
inherits the rhythm and not just the words.
