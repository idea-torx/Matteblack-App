# Storyboard — long-form scenes

Use this when the ask is a *story* — a short film, an episode, a narrated piece — that needs a board
before it needs shots. It covers both shooting modes; the user picks, you follow.

## 0. Ask which mode, once, then hold it

**Text-to-video (t2v)** — every shot generated from the prompt alone. No keyframes, no
`referenceUrls` on any shot. Use MiniMax H3 Max: `model: "h3-max-t2v"`. It is text-to-video only,
so a reference URL on that model silently reroutes the job to another family — if a shot needs a
reference, it is not a t2v shot.

**Image-to-video (i2v)** — keyframe each shot as a still, then animate it by passing that image's URL in
`referenceUrls`. Follow the `bridge` skill for the chaining; this board still drives the order.
Leave `model` off and set `tier` (quick / standard / pro) — the app picks the reference-capable
family for you.

If the user said which they want, that is the mode for the whole piece. If they did not, say which one
you are using and why in one line, and go. **Never mix modes inside one story** and never switch
mid-sequence: the two paths look different on screen, and a cut between them reads as two films.

Lock `durationSeconds`, `resolution` and `aspectRatio` on shot 1 and never change them mid-story.
H3 Max takes integer 5–15s, "480p" or "768p", and 21:9 / 16:9 / 4:3 / 1:1 / 3:4 / 9:16.

## 1. The style block

Write one block and it carries the whole piece. In t2v it is the *only* consistency mechanism you have —
no image ever crosses between shots, so the repeated text is the continuity. In i2v it still matters: the
keyframes carry the picture, the block keeps the language from drifting under them. Paste it verbatim, character for character, at the head of every single shot prompt. Paraphrasing it is
the same as changing the cast.

```
LOOK: [film stock, lens, grade, lighting — one sentence, e.g. "shot on 35mm, 40mm anamorphic,
      desaturated teal grade, hard low sun from frame left"]
CAST: [one line per recurring character, 20–30 words: age, build, hair, face, wardrobe with exact
      colours, one unmistakable detail — "a brass pocket watch on a chain", "a scar through the left
      eyebrow". Vague people come back as different people.]
WORLD: [location, era, season, time of day, weather]
CAMERA: [the grammar — handheld / locked tripod / slow dolly — and lens height]
```

Rules that decide whether a text-to-video sequence holds together:
- Every noun in CAST gets a colour or a material. "A man in a coat" is a new man each time; "a wiry man
  in his fifties, close-cropped grey hair, olive canvas coat with a torn right cuff" is the same man.
- Never describe a character by name only after the first shot — the name means nothing to the model.
  Repeat the full locked description in shot 7 exactly as in shot 1.
- Keep the block's word order fixed. Reordering re-weights it.
- Never change lens, grade, or weather between shots unless the story explicitly cuts elsewhere — and
  when it does, say so in the prompt ("cut to:").

## 2. The arc — decide what changes before you decide what happens

A board whose rows are only *events* reads as footage. A beat is not a thing that happens, it is a
thing that **changes** — a state the viewer can name before and after. Write the arc first, in prose,
one line per beat, then fill the board from it.

Pick the shape from the runtime, not from ambition:

| Runtime | Beats | Shape |
|---------|-------|-------|
| 15–30s | 3 | setup → turn → consequence |
| 45–90s | 4 | setup → complication → turn → consequence |
| 2–4min | 5 | setup → complication → escalation → turn → consequence |
| longer | acts | three of the above chained, each with its own turn |

- **Setup** establishes the normal, so the turn has something to break. It is the shortest beat, never
  the longest — one shot is usually enough.
- **Complication / escalation** raise the cost of the same want. If beat 3 could swap places with
  beat 2 and the piece still works, it is not escalation, it is repetition — cut one.
- **The turn** is the one beat the piece exists for. Something is irreversible after it. If you cannot
  say in one sentence what can no longer be undone, there is no turn yet.
- **Consequence** shows the new normal. It does not explain the turn; it lets the viewer see the cost.

Write each beat as `[before] → [after]`: "alone and unbothered → alone and aware she is being
watched". Two adjacent beats with the same before-and-after are one beat written twice — delete one and
give its seconds to the turn.

Then check the arc against the board once, before generating:
- Every beat is one row minimum. A beat spread over three shots is fine; a shot serving no beat is cut.
- The turn gets the most screen time and the tightest framing of the piece.
- Nothing in the arc depends on dialogue, text on screen, or a name — the model renders none of them.

## 3. Storyboard the whole thing before generating anything

Write the full board first and show it to the user. Each scene is one row:

| # | Beat (what changes) | Action (ONE action) | Camera | Duration | Continuity carry |
|---|---------------------|---------------------|--------|----------|------------------|

- 5–15s per shot; 8s is the honest working length. A 2-minute piece is ~15 shots.
- One action per shot. Two actions produce a clip that does neither.
- "Continuity carry" is what the viewer recognises from the previous shot — the same coat, the same key
  light direction, a movement continuing across the cut. Every shot needs one, or it reads as a different
  film.
- Total the runtime and price it with `estimate_cost` once, for the whole board. One yes covers the
  whole shoot — then shoot it all without stopping to re-ask.

## 4. Shot prompt template (use verbatim)

```
[STYLE BLOCK, pasted unchanged]

SHOT [n]: [one action, present tense, 20–40 words].
CAMERA: [move and framing for this shot].
CONTINUITY: [what carries over from shot n-1].
```

Generate shots strictly in board order, reporting shot number and URL as each lands. If one breaks the
look, regenerate that shot alone — never restart the sequence.

## 5. Assemble

When every shot exists, call `set_timeline` with the full ordered clip list (src, durationSeconds,
short label) plus its audio: a single music bed from one `generate_music` call sized to the whole
runtime — not one per scene — and, if the piece is narrated, each `generate_voiceover` line on its own
track at the second its shot starts, with the bed ducked under it. Then `save_cut` with the
project slug, the title, the style block verbatim, the board,
and every shot's exact prompt and URL. The style block in the manifest is what lets a sequel be shot in
the same world a month later.

## 6. Learn from the run

Anything the user changed about *how* you worked — a mode they overrode, a shot length they kept
shortening, a style block they rewrote, a board they cut down — is a `remember` note, one fact per slug,
written as a directive to your future self. What they changed about *this story* belongs in `save_cut`;
what they changed about your method belongs in memory, and reusing a slug replaces the stale version.
